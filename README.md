## Problem Statement
The problem we are addressing through this project is that the warranty cards created with the current system on the eCommerce platforms can easily be duplicated and misused.
## Thought Process
By using our suggested blockchain system of the warranty card, we can prevent any frauds in this area. Digital warranties give customers additional peace of mind when purchasing luxury brands. It can also provide the purchasing history, warranty period, and other item information.
## Description
* Converting ownership authenticity and product warranty cards into decaying NFTs.
* For instance, allow brands and retailers to introduce an NFT for each of their products, which allows customers to receive the physical product along with a digital version of it.
* Customers can then use the digital NFT to verify the authenticity of their product, prove their ownership of their product, and transfer ownership of them upon resale.
* The brand/retailer should also be able to tie the digital NFT to its warranty program, allowing owners to track repairs and replacements to the original item.
* Decay the NFT once the warranty is over.
* We can use the Algorand blockchain to deploy our solution and demo the final product as a web prototype.

## What one can expect?
* The blockchain smart contract should allow users to prove ownership
* Provide the purchasing history, warranty period, and other item information
* The warranty card should include the item’s serial number and upon purchase be sent to the customer’s smartphone.
* The NFTs should be decaying in nature, in that, after a certain period their use for the redemption of warranty benefits offered by the brand/retailer will expire
* Usage of Algorand NFTs
* Add any engagement/gamification construct to the loyalty program
